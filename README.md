# Vim Settings
These are my current .vimrc settings for my machine as well as my kitty.conf
file.
You will need to create a  .vimrc file in your home directory.
You can replace the kitty.conf file located in  
~/.config/kitty with mine. 

For neovim you add the init.vim file to your
~/.config/nvim directory. 
If you don't have the nvim directory make it.
